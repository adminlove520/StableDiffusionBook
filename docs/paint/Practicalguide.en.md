# Practical Guide

This short practical guide will give you a quick overview of how to adjust the parameters appropriately to achieve the desired effect.

Currently, Ai does not handle details and multiple characters well, and the light and shadow structure will be messed up if handled one by one. If retouching, it is better to redraw. But it is practical to draw backgrounds and do previews.

**The core logic is to narrow the range of pre-selected data, adjust the balance between negative and positive prompts, and use part of the grammar to control the intensity of the prompt word effect and the process of effect.**

### Extras for hypersegmented images

WebUi's `extras` page has its own extras function, which can be used to enhance the image quality using models like `ESRGAN_4x`.

If you want to extrascape Anime style illustrations, please use the `realesrgan` or [realcugan](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real-CUGAN) tools directly for extrascape.

## WebUi Guide to Assisted Drawing

Want to re-draw or add elements manually with WebUi? Here's a little guide.

First of all, the effect of IMG2IMG2 and Inpaint is completely different. If you don't want the style to change, don't choose IMG2IMG2.

To avoid image stretching, the sizes should all be **as close to the original size as possible, choose `Crop and resize` which means crop and resize**

**Masked Content**

The `Masked content` related setting determines the content placed into the masked area before the repair, it determines the initial reference content (origin is the content of the mask before blurring, and latent nosie is referenced by noise (many random pigment dots).

![aidrawfix2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75739606/201613751-9da2ffd6-2c1f-439b-8e9a-75b185c99912.png)

latent noise is what determines the Ai reference, while Denoising strength can be interpreted as the degree of unreference to the reference.

**Changing elements**

If we need to change the elements, we can key and paste them.

If we need to add elements, we can use PS to graft a hand to the character and let Ai touch it up, or we can graft the lower body of another work for a bust without a lower body and let AI touch it up.

![test1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75739606/201602016-e14b69e3-f250-4af7-b200-a421d163130b.png)

**Make changes based on the original image**

Using Inpaint, the main scene is removal/replacement.

Start by tracing thin lines around the edges of the figure, then hitting the color block (if there are shadows, take **bright colors** or draw full shadows). Change the intensity to choose a lower denoising of around 0.3 (the lower the closer to the input image).

Then use Img2Img Inpaint + relevant cue words to fix, not satisfied can be changed again until satisfied. Then the image is realesrgan superscored to remove the image texture.

![fix_exp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75739606/201603999-1ae18fb9-5435-49f0-9adf-0789e9659a29.png)

**Grafted image**

Use PS software to add and remove elements and then re-produce them. This can solve the problem of drawing hands.

Ai also accepts other finished images for grafting (example of application: solving the problem of lying down without lower body)

### Multi-figure/single-figure

sketching + IMG2IMG, this is the secret ~

Wide painting single figure generation is best to play the sketch, for color painting, to determine the main body of the picture.

Multi-figure to determine the number of characters, it is best to use the draft / colored 3d arrangement + figure generation.

More than three people will be difficult to control the effect, the number of people greater than 6 in the image model is not estimated...

### Perform palm restoration

Feed the image into inpaint, use roughly the same cue words, put the cue about the `hand` in front, set the noise reduction depending on how much you want it to change (to 0.25 or less if you just want the hand to be more intact), then keep the steps the same as CFG and txt2img gen.

Or just mask the hand, fix it at full resolution, greatly reduce the padding (it uses the surrounding pixels to create the context, but is only re-creating the hand) and only hint at hand issues (detailed hand depiction, etc.)

The higher the CFG, the more it matches the cue words, and the higher the noise reduction the more it deviates from the original image.

### Identical Characters & Differences

We can use LoRA to train a style model of similar characters, then use VRoid to roughly reproduce the characters and export them to VRM format, then use UE5's Control Rig function to adjust their movements, and finally use the Img2Img method to generate these characters with the same appearance. [^13]

For expressions or backgrounds, the Redraw (part of Img2Img) technique from the advanced tutorial can be used.

- ControlNet

ControlNet is a neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions.

https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet

### Iterative sketching [^8]

Here is a discussion of how to optimize **hand sketches** by Ai drawing, *note not quadratic*.

In the first iteration, not too many Steps are needed, CFG can be very low (for better diversification results), and Denoising should be around 0.3-0.4 if you don't want to lose the sketch completely.

In the final iteration, increase Steps and Denoising intensity (but not more than 0.8, otherwise the image will be corrupted, especially at greater than 512*512) see [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/2213#issuecomment- 1274137775), while increasing the CFG and size as needed.

You can always fix the hints (add or remove details that appear) and try a different sampler.

Also, shouldn't you use a fixed constant seed for initial generation?

If you provide a seed (instead of a random -1), your image will soon become oversaturated, oversharpened, and overpixelated. .... Of course you can use a fixed seed if you want to fine tune it.

### Colour rather than lines

Whether it's 3D (3D models like DAZ) or line art, AI only recognizes **color**, not lines, and color directly determines the effect of figure to figure conversion.

If you want to fix the lines, then the noise reduction should be reduced to 0.2.

## Curbing style pollution

Introduces how to generate images in WebUi with the subject as the focus, rather than the style of the drawing.[^12]

To get the desired result, we change `style` to `[style:10]` 

In Automatic 1111's WebUi prompt method, [x:10] tells Stable Diffusion until the tenth step before rendering the prompt.

By the time 10 steps are reached, a basic image has been formed, so styling pollutes the main component recklessly, instead acting like an IMG2IMG (which you can think of as a form of Img2img) over the existing image

You can experiment with this number depending on how many overall steps you've done. If you change the format to [x:0.2] (i.e. a number below 1) then it becomes a percentage, [x:0.6] tells SD to wait until 60% of the total number of steps before implementing x, and so on.

## Size selection

It should not be linked to picture quality; size affects the subject to some extent, as it potentially represents the category chosen (e.g. vertical figures, horizontal landscapes, small resolution emojis mostly).

Picture quality can be manipulated using the Super Score guide.

## Painting soldering!

With [AiPhotoShop - the online tool for infinite extents of canvas](https://www.painthua.com/) you can "weld" your work continuously, very conveniently. Just add the `--api` parameter to the start command and open the web page to use it.

> Image extents for some anime models are not supported because they are not Inpaint models (Sd has a dedicated Inpaint model.)

## Trivial details

- Emoticons

emoji(💰💶💷💴💵,🎊🪅🪄🎀,👩🚀) Emoticons are also available and **very accurate**, and Ai can recognize emoji after I tested it many times.

emoji performs well in terms of semantic accuracy because it has only one character.

[emoji reference](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html)

- Anime style

`anime coloring` will have a good effect, like anime screenshots. (If you encounter black and white, you need to specify the color of the character parts)

[some_art_styles_that_i_tried](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/yllj3r/some_art_styles_that_i_tried/)

### Optimize the effect of your work

- Take a look at the goal

Think about what you want your work to be tagged with on the internet.

A sticker wouldn't say `masterpiece, best quility,` would it?

Another thing is that if the request is for a pixel work, you should remove some negative hints of conflict (if any).

- Adjustment of order

The words in front anchor the color distribution of the image. What is important what goes first.

- Semantic offset prevention

To prevent semantic shifts, prioritize emoji, and then use less complex syntax like `with` unnecessarily.

- Keying?

The rest of the background of a buttoned image will be treated as black.

If you need a background, the effect is generally not very good, and it is recommended to fill in the color before operating.

- Protect images from being cut by split lines

It should improve.

## Reproduction

If you want to reproduce on generation, you need the same `seed`, cue words, and other parameters (even size). But if the other side uses stylization, then you can hardly reproduce it.

-- Self-deceptive reproduction: figure to figure, noise reduction pulled to below 0.3... --

## Associated

The core logic of cross-domain terminology is to **narrow the scope of the specified data** and start with **platforms, domains, events** outside of the screen content to enhance the effect.

Yes! You can use [Film Glossary](https://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~engl377/film.html) [FILM GLOSSARY Photography Terminology](http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/anthro) in the prompt /jbeatty/COURSES/glossary.htm), [Cinematic techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cinematic_techniques), and painting terms (types) to control the basics.

Crossover! You can even use various thrill-sport terms to produce some special effects .... such as airborne

for example, depth of field, aperture, composition, camera position, elements of movement, [a Chinese introduction to the glossary of artistic photography](https://gallerix.asia/pedia/photography-glossary/)

**BUT** this effect may have the added effect of introducing data into the picture that you don't want to see in the style (e.g. live action** rather than **but secondary). Get the measurements right. Add Step and style cues as appropriate to improve.

You can also use **platform names** to limit the scope of the dataset, for example, terms like pixiv.

## Designing with Ai

- Backgrounds

Once you get a slightly more saturated photo, you can process it in AI and use it as a background.

Use `anime coloring` to enhance the anime style.

- Icons

[Look at this](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1384y1B7MX)

- Emotion packs

The emojis work really well. The `sticker` with the western face script is very well done!

The documentation writer has tried the following prompt and it produces high quality emojis.

Don't ask for quality prompt words for stickers.

**positive vocabulary**

```
1girl,sticker,Chibi,Q,
white background,
```
`masterpiece,best quality` may or may not be added, if quality is not enough

`lowres` can be added or not, add if not vintage enough

`Chibi` controls the character to be Q (big head, small body), add if not Q enough

`sticker` is to specify the style as a social media sticker, required

**negative vocabulary**

```
bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry, bad feet
```

low quality can be added or not, if you want to be more flat, please add `3D` to negative hints.

Size required square.

## Prompt

SEE [HERE](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/howto%3Atag_checklist) From[Origin wiki](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/tag_groups)

### NAI in use out parameters

- Use the full model

- CLIP layer = 2

- Use ema weight loading, set `use_ema` to true in the yaml configuration

- reset ` sigma noise/strength` to the default value of 1

- set `eta noise seed delta` to 31337 (so that ` sigma noise/strength` does not need to use 0.69 / 0.67)

- If prompt has weights, convert the weights (WebUi to 1.1, NAI to 1.05)

- Use the `-no-half` parameter to start the program (secondary)

**NAI default model settings**

```
steps": 28, "sampler": "[sampler]", "seed": [seed], "strength": 0.69, "noise": 0.667, "scale": 11.0,

Strength ， noise 是 eta 和 sigma

scale 就是 CFG scale
```

**NAI default `SFW` negative prompt**

```
lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry
```

**other**

Add `masterpiece, best quality` in front of all prompt words

Clip skip 0, everything else is fine (afaik don't use supernet, v2, yaml, VAE)

### Conversions - NAI and WebUi(SD) have different enhanced syntax

**Prompts parameter bracket conversion**
