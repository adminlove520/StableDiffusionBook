# DreamBooth

> TODO/HELP Audit

## Introduction

[DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) is a way to customize a personalized TextToImage diffusion model. Excellent results can be obtained with only a small amount of training data.

Dreambooth is based on [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/) and can be used by simply exporting the model as a ckpt, which can then be loaded into various UIs.

However, neither the Imagen model nor the pre-trained weights are available. So the original Dreambooth was not suitable for Stable Diffusion. However, [diffusers](https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers) later implements [Dreambooth](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth) and is fully adapted to Stable Diffusion.

> Diffusers provides pre-trained diffusion models across multiple modalities (e.g. visual and audio) and is supported as a modular toolbox for diffusion model inference and training.

This section uses the [diffusers](https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth) branch version of Shivam Shirao to explain the parameters, with a configuration derived from [ShivamShrirao/diffusers](https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth).

We recommend using CCRcmcpe's [optimized branch](https://github.com/CCRcmcpe/diffusers/tree/yaml-config) for Stable Diffusion, which can be used with Yaml files.

## Preparation

If you choose to use the AutoDl image, you will need to move the dreambooth-for- diffusion folder to autodl-tmp (the data disk) and make sure that the path (the string before the #) is dreambooth-for-diffusion, as detailed in the [tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/584736850) The details are illustrated in the tutorial [].

### Model transformation

The following type of command is available in each notebook or mirror and serves to convert the ckpt model to diffusers weight format for training.

- Pre-training example

```bash
    python diffusers\scripts\convert_original_stable_diffusion_to_diffusers.py --checkpoint_path model.ckpt --original_config_file v1-inference.yaml --scheduler_type ddim --dump_path models/diffusers_model
```

- Post-training example

The training is also packaged and converted to ckpt, which can be used in various UI's.

```bash
    python diffusers\scripts\convert_diffusers_to_original_stable_diffusion.py --model_path models/resultModel --checkpoint_path result.ckpt --half
```

### Datasets

The creation of the dataset is the most important part of getting good, consistent results in Dreambooth training.

* Content requirements

Always use high quality samples, content such as motion blur or low resolution can be trained into the model and affect the quality of the work.

When training for a specific style, pick samples that have good consistency. Ideally, only pick images of the artist you are training. Avoid fan art or anything with a different style, unless your goal is something like stylistic fusion.

For themes, samples with black or white backgrounds are extremely helpful.

> Transparent backgrounds work too, but sometimes they leave a white outline around the subject, so I don't recommend using them at the moment.

If you need to make your Dreambooth model more varied, try to use different environments, lighting, hair styles, expressions, poses, angles and distances from the subject.

Be sure to include images with normal backgrounds (e.g. of the object in a scene). Using only images with simple backgrounds will be less effective.

Avoid having hands stuck to the head in your renders by removing all images where the hands are too close to or touching the head.

If you need to avoid a fisheye lens effect in your renders, remove all selfie images.

To avoid unnatural over-blurring, make sure the image does not contain a false heavy depth of field or vignetting.

* Adjustment

Once you have collected the photos for your dataset, crop and resize all images to a 512x512 square (you can batch crop using the [BIRME](https://www.onlinephotosoft.com/birme/) online tool) and remove any watermarks, logos, people/limb cut off by the edges of the image, or anything else you don't want to be trained on. Save the images in PNG format and place all images in the train folder.

### Annotating images

You can annotate manually or automatically using clip or deepdanbooru.

We recommend using [crosstyan/blip_helper](https://github.com/crosstyan/blip_helper) to label your images. Or use [DeepDanbooru](https://github.com/KichangKim/DeepDanbooru) and [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP)

If you use AutoDl's mirrors, you can use the built-in [label_images.py](https://github.com/CrazyBoyM/dreambooth-for-diffusion/blob/main/tools/label_images.py) for labelling.

#### Augmentation

* There are many ways to manipulate data: the most common are inversion, rotation, brightness and cropping.

Related examples for reference [Further improve the accuracy of Diffusers-based DreamBooth: augmentation edition](https://note.com/kohya_ss/n/nad3bce9a3622).

> It may be useful to break up the image, or to crop the background/headers etc. separately.

## Parameters

First let's look at the Yaml configuration file from [CCRcmcpe diffusers version](https://github.com/CCRcmcpe/diffusers/blob/748f64e47cd6fe3ebe5e6fe7011ee90c5a672fd3/examples/dreambooth/configs/ dreambooth.yaml#L10) of the Yaml configuration file.

DreamBooth itself cannot train the so-called painting style. Instead, Native Training fine-tunes the model to bring about a change in the painting style as a so-called painting style training method.

The classical idea is.
```
Native + deepdanbooru->prompt txt - "training style"
Dreambooth + class prompt/instance prompt - training objects
```

But there are many more categories, with differences such as: whether to pair Prompt to each image, whether to enable prior_preservation loss (PPL), whether to use train text encoder (TTL) [^4]

DreamBooth = instance + class with `prior preservation loss` (where the difference is between giving images separate tags, and using a single tag).

### DreamBooth

Specialises in training specific objects/people. Use `-with_prior_preservation` to enable DreamBooth, **Only DreamBooth training uses the concept of `[V]` and the parameters associated with `-instance_prompt`. **

- Instance Image the object you are training on

- The default implementation of Instance Prompt is to share a prompt globally, which may work for a few shots, i.e. DreamBooth (original paper method). However, when you have more targets to train you can turn on the `combine_prompt_from_txt` option and have a prompt (usually a txt) for each instance, i.e. DreamBooth (alternative method). The Instance Prompt should contain a unique identifier [V]. See below for a detailed explanation. [^4]

- Class/Regularization Image corresponds to `--class_data_dir` and should be **autogenerated** i.e. an auto-generated image, used to detect AI prior knowledge. You should not put any non-AI generated images. (Why not use Native Training if you are sure about this?) Adulteration of same-style images in clas images is no longer encouraged. Each time you retrain a different subject, you have to clear it once.

- Class Prompt corresponds to `--class_prompt`, which is arbitrary, and is generated automatically; it is recommended that it be generated separately from other inference front-ends that support CLIP SKIP 2 and then dropped into the class img set. The program can also read the contents from a separate txt. [^4]

DreamBooth itself has a very strong copy and paste effect, which can be suppressed by using class/regularization. [^4]

For training multiple objects read the *Multiple Concept* section.

- Example [train_object.sh](https://github.com/CrazyBoyM/dreambooth-for-diffusion/blob/main/train_object.sh)

### Native Training

Unlike DreamBooth, Native Training uses your training set to train directly and does not require a Class Image.

Turning off the `prior_preservation` option to start training natively is the recommended way to "train in style".

There is no Instance/Class Image distinction in this training, all graphs are used for training. However, you need to prepare an Instance Prompt for each image, in a text file with the same name as the image, usually a txt, for example [dataset exp](https://github.com/chavinlo/stable-diffusion-scripts/tree/main/dataset-examples)

This txt file with the same name as the image is subsequently read as a label by enabling `--use_txt_as_label` (this option ignores the content of the instance_prompt argument passed in).

Native Training requires **more** datasets, but the amount varies, in the range [100, 10000], more is better (but manual selection is still recommended)

- Example [train_style.sh](https://github.com/CrazyBoyM/dreambooth-for-diffusion/blob/main/train_style.sh)

### Parameters

- with_prior_preservation

**Enable prior_preservation to start DreamBooth training, disable to enable Native Training.**

- prior_loss_weight 

The lower it is, the harder it is to fit, but also the harder it is to learn something. [^4][^3] 

* learning_rate learning_rate

DreamBooth itself has a very strong copy and paste effect. Use class/regularization to suppress the effect appropriately.

* use_txt_as_label

Typically used when training a fine-tuned model in Native. Enabling this option turns off DreamBooth, which ignores the `instance_prompt` argument and reads the label from the txt file instead.

- center_crop 

The script comes with an option to crop the image, it is recommended that you crop it to a square.

- resolution 

The resolution of the image (usually 512), defining this parameter will scale the image.

- max_train_steps

The maximum number of training steps, usually 1000, if your dataset is large then increase the value.

The number of training steps is generally chosen such that training steps = (reference image x 100).

- save_model_every_n_steps

Save_model_every_steps is a good way to see the intermediate training results and find the best model, it can also be used to restore the last training results from a checkpoint (colab laptop users are advised to mount to the cloud).

- lr_scheduler

learning rate moderator, optionally `constant, linear, cosine, cosine_with_restarts, cosine_with_hard_restarts`

- with_prior_preservation

Enable prior_preservation to start DreamBooth training.Disable to enable Native Training

- prior_loss_weight

the lower prior_loss_weight the harder it is to fit, but also the harder it is to learn. [^4][^3] 

### Explanation of Instance Prompt / Class Prompt

class prompt will be used to generate a class of images that will be treated as something like `photo of a person`

instance prompt will be processed as something like `photo of a cute person`

- Examples

* Example of a training character
* Instance prompt: `masterpiece, best quality, sks 1girl, aqua eyes, aqua hair`
* Class prompt: `masterpiece, best quality, 1girl, aqua eyes, aqua hair`

* Examples of training styles *
* Instance prompt: `1girl, by sks`
* Class prompt: `1girl`

### About [V]

| What your training set is about | Instance prompt must contain | Class prompt should describe |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| A object/person | `[V]` | The object's type and/or characteristics |
| A artist's style | `by [V]` | The common characteristics of the training set |

[V] is only used in the Instance prompt and is a token in the CLIP vocabulary that has no meaning for the model. **This is a phrase set by you, analogous to the unknown quantity x of the equation, not an exact value called `[V]`. **

Suppose the character you want to train is called `[N]` (e.g. `Mr. Balabalabala`) , you should not use `[N]` (`Mr. Balabalabala`) directly as a representative feature word. [^4]

It is recommended to use the word `[V]` (e.g. `bala`) that exists in [this glossary](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14/raw/main/vocab.json) but has no corresponding concept or where the corresponding concept is not obvious.

Long names are likely to be separated into multiple tokens and will not have the desired effect. The separation of tokens can be verified at [NovelAI Tokenizer](https://novelai.net/tokenizer).

The final hint representing [V] will carry the new things learned by the model and you will be able to use the [V] you set when generating it.

> Note: The example word `sks` used in the original paper is the same as the real firearm [SKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKS) and is not a suitable word to be used. However, if you are sufficiently trained you may be able to override its impact.

TIPS: Don't use the default by sks (the artist sks), fusion models can be a disaster.

### Explanation of Subject images / Class images

Introduction from [^2]

Subject images (or instance images as you see them in your notebook) are the images you want to train on, so if you want your own looking model, you can take 20 to 40 of your own images and input those. The instance name is a unique identifier that will indicate the trained object in the prompt, personally I use "namelastname", most notebooks use "sks" but it is best to change it.

You are in effect telling the AI to introduce you to the database, to do this you choose a class, i.e. the one that best fits the class you are training, for people it is common to use "person", "man"/"woman" etc.

The purpose of using Class images in training is to **prevent features of objects from "bleeding over" into other objects of the same Class**. Without Class images as reference points, the AI will merge your face with other faces that appear in the Class. **Your face will infiltrate the other faces generated by the model. **

DreamBooth can start training without Class images, just disable `-with_prior_preservation` to enable Native Training.

### Native Training

Native Training is native training. Unlike DreamBooth, Native Training uses your training set for training directly and does not require Class images.

Turning off the `-prior_preservation` option (aka the `-with_prior_preservation` parameter) to start training natively is the recommended way to train in the style.

There is no Instance/Class Image distinction in this training, all images will be used for training. However, you need to prepare an Instance Prompt for each image, with the same file name as the traditional hypernetwork, usually txt.

!!! tip "About this Txt"
    For each image in the dataset ([X].png/[X].jpg), put a [X].txt with the corresponding hint, then set `READ_PROMPT_FROM_TXT` (`--use_txt_as_label`). The prompts read from txt [PX] will be inserted into the prompt [P] you set in the training parameters. By default, it is inserted as [PX][P]. 
    
    With Variable Prompts enabled and Prior Preservation Loss (PRIOR_PRESERVATION) disabled, the training process is effectively equivalent to standard fine-tuning. Native Training requires a large dataset, but the amount varies, and is in the range [100, 10000], so more is better. (manual selection is recommended) 

#### labeled method 

You can annotate manually or use clip or deepdanbooru for automatic annotation. We recommend using [crosstyan/blip_helper](https://github.com/crosstyan/blip_helper) to label your images. or use [DeepDanbooru](https://github.com/KichangKim/DeepDanbooru) and [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP) If you use AutoDl's mirrors, you can use the built-in [label_images.py](https://github.com/CrazyBoyM/dreambooth-for-diffusion/blob/main/tools/label_images.py) for labelling.

### Resume training from checkpoint

The MODEL_NAME of the parameter is changed to the position of the last model.

If you use `CLASS_DIR`, you don't need to clear it because the subject is the same, but vice versa.

### Train Text Encoder

The use of `-train_text_encoder` in the corresponding example is not recommended. With `--train_text_encoder`, Dreambooth training trains additional text encoders, making it impossible to generalize the prompt between different models.

There is a metaphysical argument that this should be turned off after a certain percentage/epoch/step of training has been reached to prevent overplaying.

* The instance prompt you write at the beginning should be long and summarise your training goal (but not so long that it covers your usual words) (e.g. girl I would replace with woman, 1boy with male)
* Firstly, the text prompt should be read in as a mail. Because too many words are distracting, the effect is not obvious.
* Secondly, the instance prompt cannot be filled in with just one `[V]`, otherwise the word will be wasted too.
* Try a big fire burst

If you refine the call, add the word you trained for instance prompt, depending on how much flavour you want.

Maybe it's also effective when training characters.

### Multiple Concept

With DreamBooth it is possible to train multiple concepts/characters/actions/objects with the `--concept_list` argument in the example. However, if you train two characters, you cannot infer that they are both present at the same time, and their features will be mixed.

If you check the `--concept_list` parameter with other versions of the DreamBooth training method, you can read in a similar `json` file.

* concepts_list.json

```
# You can also add multiple concepts here. Try tweaking `--max_train_steps` accordingly.

concepts_list = [
    {
        "instance_prompt":      "photo of zwx dog",
        "class_prompt":         "photo of a dog",
        "instance_data_dir":    "/content/data/zwx",
        "class_data_dir":       "/content/data/dog"
    },
#     {
#         "instance_prompt":      "photo of ukj person",
#         "class_prompt":         "photo of a person",
#         "instance_data_dir":    "/content/data/ukj",
#         "class_data_dir":       "/content/data/person"
#     }
]

# `class_data_dir` contains regularization images
```

### Aspect Ratio Bucketing

Corresponds to `--use_aspect_ratio_bucket` in the argument above. If you need to use it in Colab, `-aspect_ratio_bucket` is set to `enable: true`.

[Aspect Ratio Bucketing](https://github.com/NovelAI/novelai-aspect-ratio-bucketing) is known as ARB, the original training only works with `1:1` images, enabling ARB makes it possible to train non-`1:1` images, but not at any scale, and images not in the bucket will be cropped.

```
[[ 256 1024], [ 320 1024], [ 384 1024], [ 384  960], [ 384  896], [ 448  832], [ 512  768], [ 512  704], [ 512  512], [ 576  640], [ 640  576], [ 704  512], [ 768  512], [ 832  448], [ 896  384], [ 960  384], [1024  384], [1024  320], [1024  256]]
```

> ARB is not compatible with DreamBooth and is only recommended for Native Training.

## Training

Follow the notebook steps or instructions to train, Colab users should be careful to mount the disk to prevent disconnection.

After training, convert the diffusers weights to a ckpt file before you can use them! Use a file like `diffusers2ckpt.py`.

> Some scripts provide a `-half` parameter to save the float16 half-precision model, which halves the size of the weights file (about 2g), but the effect is essentially the same.

WebUi users copy the trained `.ckpt` file into the `models\Stable-diffusion` directory of webui and switch between models in the top left corner of webui to use it.

To use it, enter the flags you specified before in `prompt` (e.g. <balabala>) to get the ai to add what you want to the generated image.

The effect of the model will depend on the test image.

## Using on Windows

The content here is suitable for who want to train on Windows systems.

From [^18]

`Dreambooth` on Windows can use an optimized version of ShivamShrirao to save VRAM, [diffusers/examples/dreambooth](https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth) by ShivamShrirao.

The deployment method used for `Linux` cannot be used directly on windows due to the associated library, and for the same reason the minimum 9.9G of RAM required for this optimised version on colab should be slightly higher on windows, so it is recommended to use **at least a 12G VRAM** GPU.

> i has only tested this on machines with 16G of RAM, 12G of RAM is theoretically possible.

!!! tip
    When modifying or overwriting files in the original repository, please make a backup.

Prepare your environment with `Git`, `Python`, `MiniConda` (or `MiniConda`).

The following steps work in python 3.8, windows 10 22H2, other environments have not been tested

**Create a working directory in which to build the venv virtual environment for python 3.8**

```bash
    python -m venv --system-site-packages venv_dbwin
    venv_dbwin\Scripts\activate
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Clone the optimized version of dreambooth for ShivamShrirao into the working directory and install the relevant dependencies (using [build version](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/7465397f33d5de75dcccc155e3fb9a232fcbb0a0), which may not be supported in subsequent versions) method)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
cd examples\dreambooth
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
pip install OmegaConf
pip install pytorch_lightning
pip install einops
pip install bitsandbytes==0.34
```

Once this is done, you will need to implement bitsandbytes support on windows according to the methods in [this issue](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/issues/30#issuecomment-1257676341)

Manually copy the `libbitsandbytes_cuda116.dll` file from [this repository](https://github.com/DeXtmL/bitsandbytes-win-prebuilt) to the `venv_diffusers\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes` in the working directory next to `libbitsandbytes_cuda116.so`.

Then change the script to apply it, either manually or, for convenience, by downloading the following file to replace it.

Overwrite `cextension.py` - https://pastebin.com/jjgxuh8V with the `venv_diffusers\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes` directory.

Overwrite `main.py` - https://pastebin.com/BsEzpdpw to the `venv_diffusers\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\cuda_setup` directory.

**Set PyTorch & Torchvision**

 `pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116`

**Test**

```
    python
    >>>import bitsandbytes
```

If no errors are reported the installation is successful (`Ctrl + Z` and enter to exit python).

#### Interim Guide

**Set up accelerate**

```
    accelerate config

    In which compute environment are you running? ([0] This machine, [1] AWS (Amazon SageMaker)): 0
    Which type of machine are you using? ([0] No distributed training, [1] multi-CPU, [2] multi-GPU, [3] TPU [4] MPS): 0
    Do you want to run your training on CPU only (even if a GPU is available)? [yes/NO]:NO
    Do you want to use DeepSpeed? [yes/NO]:NO
    Do you wish to use FP16 or BF16 (mixed precision)? [NO/fp16/bf16]: fp16
```

Follow the setting options above, i.e. (0, 0, NO, NO, fp16).

**Videosity Occupancy Optimization**

Since xformers are not available, use optimization method in the
 [file](https://github.com/lucidrains/memory-efficient-attention-pytorch/blob/main/memory_efficient_attention_pytorch/flash_attention.py) instead.

将 attention.py - https://pastebin.com/nmwTrGB9 覆盖到 `diffusers\src\diffusers\models` 目录。

**The environment is now configured and ready for training.**

```bash
        accelerate launch --num_cpu_threads_per_process 8 diffusers/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth.py --pretrained_model_name_or_path=models/diffusers_model --pretrained_vae_name_or_path=models/diffusers_model/vae --output_dir=models --concepts_list="concepts_list.json" --with_prior_preservation --prior_loss_weight=1.0 --seed=1337 --resolution=512 --mixed_precision="fp16" --lr_scheduler="constant" --use_8bit_adam --gradient_accumulation_steps=1 --train_batch_size=1 --max_train_steps=800 --save_interval=10000 --learning_rate=1e-6 --num_class_images=100 --lr_warmup_steps=0 --gradient_checkpointing
```

If you only have one graphics card with no more than 12G of video memory and need to use it for Windows, please close all programs or web pages that consume video memory to reduce additional memory consumption before training.

diffusers cannot be trained directly using ckpt files, they need to be converted first, as shown in the example below.

```bash
    python diffusers\scripts\convert_original_stable_diffusion_to_diffusers.py  --checkpoint_path model.ckpt  --original_config_file v1-inference.yaml  --scheduler_type ddim  --dump_path models/diffusers_model
```

The training is also packaged and converted to ckpt for use in the WebUI of AUTOMATIC1111.

```
    python diffusers\scripts\convert_diffusers_to_original_stable_diffusion.py  --model_path models/resultModel  --checkpoint_path result.ckpt  --half
```

> This is a temporary solution.
