## Adding links

If you want to add a link, you need to submit a PR. Readme links are added by the repository maintainers themselves and no PRs are accepted.
For contributors, the following entries are required to add a link.

**Content requirements**

* Current

* Content on a topic that is consistent with the content of the wiki and that is not obviously commercially promoted.

**Access**

* Material must be backable (e.g. web to PDF, etc.) or provide a transparent download of the original material.

* Must be publicly viewable.

## Formatting requirements

Accuracy is understood first, coverage second.

### Commit Specification

* The commit message should briefly describe the changes.

* The commit summary should be no more than 45 characters long. If necessary, please provide details in the body of the message.

For commit summaries, the following format is recommended.

```
<modification type>(<filename>): <what was changed>
```

There are several types of modification.

    feat: add content

    fix: fixes content errors

    refactor: refactor a page (larger changes)

    revert: roll back changes

### Pull Request specification

The title states the purpose of the PR (what was done). The content should briefly describe what was changed.

If you fixed an issue, add sovle #xxxx to the content, where xxxx is the issue number.

The recommended format for the title is as follows.

```
<modification type> (<filename>): <modified content> (<issue number>)
```

There are several types of modification.

    feat: add content

    fix: fixes a content error

    refactor: refactor a page (larger changes)

    revert: roll back changes

### Read friendly

Consider the reader's feelings. Offbeat aliases should not appear. To use standard terminology, standardise. If new terms need to be added, add a description, or if they are more complex, add them to the glossary.

* Reject short set questions

Eliminate some unnecessary short question and answer forms

For example

```
questions
Short answers
```

should be changed to ` ` If xxx, read xxx ` `

* Formatting

Do not format the content, it is difficult to review content changes when merging.

If needed, make a special request for formatting optimisation.

* Sorting, with important sections first

The higher the frequency, the more important information should come first.

* Responsible for

If the content is only linked, please make a brief description or extract the main content. Please do not lose such short content.

```
